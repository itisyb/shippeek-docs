description: "How to authenticate your ShipPeek API requests."
---

All API requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

## API token format

Your API token combines your client ID and client secret with a period separator:

```
client_id.client_secret
```

You can find both values in your ShipPeek dashboard after signing up.

## Making authenticated requests

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shippeek.com/rates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_ID.YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## Required headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <your_token>` | All requests |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Requests with a body |
| `Accept` | `application/json` | Recommended |

## Error responses

If authentication fails, the API returns one of these responses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API token |
| `402 Payment Required` | No active ShipPeek subscription |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token valid but lacks permission for this resource |

Example error response:

```json
{
  "name": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "requestId": "req_abc123",
  "message": "Invalid API credentials"
}
```

## Security recommendations

- Store your API credentials in environment variables, not in source code.
- Use the sandbox environment (`api.shippeek.dev`) for development and testing.
- Rotate your credentials immediately if you suspect they have been compromised.
- Use separate API keys for different environments and applications.
