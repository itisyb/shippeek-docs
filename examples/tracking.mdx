## Track by PRO number

Track an LTL shipment using the carrier's PRO number:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl "https://api.shippeek.com/track/88689418?carrier=dohr" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

```javascript Node.js
const proNumber = '88689418';
const carrier = 'dohr';

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.shippeek.com/track/${proNumber}?carrier=${carrier}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.SHIPPEEK_API_TOKEN}`,
    },
  }
);

const events = await response.json();

for (const event of events) {
  console.log(`${event.eventDate} ${event.eventTime} - ${event.eventType}: ${event.summary}`);
  if (event.location) {
    console.log(`  Location: ${event.location.city}, ${event.location.state}`);
  }
}
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

pro_number = '88689418'
carrier = 'dohr'

response = requests.get(
    f'https://api.shippeek.com/track/{pro_number}',
    params={'carrier': carrier},
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.environ["SHIPPEEK_API_TOKEN"]}',
    },
)

events = response.json()
for event in events:
    location = event.get('location', {})
    city = f"{location.get('city', '')}, {location.get('state', '')}" if location else 'Unknown'
    print(f"{event['eventDate']} - {event['eventType']}: {event['summary']} ({city})")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Track a UPS shipment

```bash
curl "https://api.shippeek.com/track/1ZJ734V30334610288?carrier=upgf" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
