Use these values in the `originType` and `destType` fields. The location type affects accessorial charges -- for example, residential locations incur a residential delivery surcharge automatically.

## Available types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `business dock` | Commercial location with a loading dock (default) |
| `business no dock` | Commercial location without a loading dock |
| `residential` | Home or residential address |
| `limited access` | Location with restricted access |
| `trade show` | Trade show or exhibition venue |
| `construction` | Active construction site |
| `farm` | Agricultural or farm location |
| `military` | Military base or installation |
| `airport` | Airport facility |
| `place of worship` | Church, mosque, temple, etc. |
| `school` | Educational institution |
| `mine` | Mining operation |
| `pier` | Dock or pier facility |

## How location types affect pricing

Non-standard locations (anything other than `business dock`) typically incur additional accessorial charges from carriers. These charges are applied automatically based on the location type -- you do not need to add them to the `charges` array separately.

Common surcharges:
- **Residential** -- Residential pickup/delivery fee
- **Limited access** -- Limited access surcharge
- **Liftgate** -- Often required at locations without a dock (but must be requested separately via accessorials)

## Example

```json
{
  "originPostalCode": "60601",
  "originType": "business dock",
  "destPostalCode": "90210",
  "destType": "residential"
}
```
