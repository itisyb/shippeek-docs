Accessorials are additional services applied to a shipment. Pass them in the `charges` array of your rate request.

## LTL accessorials

| Charge | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `arrival notice` | Destination wants notification before delivery |
| `arrival schedule` | Destination requires a delivery appointment |
| `liftgate pickup` | Liftgate needed at the pickup location |
| `liftgate delivery` | Liftgate needed at the delivery location |
| `inside pickup` | Carrier brings freight inside the pickup facility |
| `inside delivery` | Carrier brings freight inside the delivery facility |
| `sort and segregate` | Carrier sorts and separates items at delivery |
| `protect from freezing` | Temperature-controlled transit to prevent freezing |

<Warning>
  `arrival notice` and `arrival schedule` are mutually exclusive. Include one or the other, not both.
</Warning>

### Facility type charges

Location-based charges (residential delivery, trade show, limited access, etc.) are applied **automatically** based on the `originType` and `destType` fields. You do not need to list them as accessorials.

For example, setting `destType: "residential"` automatically adds the residential delivery surcharge.

## Parcel accessorials

| Charge | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `signature required` | Requires a signature at delivery |
| `adult signature required` | Requires an adult signature at delivery |
| `indirect signature required` | Allows an indirect signature (FedEx only, residential destinations only) |
