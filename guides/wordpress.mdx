  <Step title="Upload to WordPress">
    In your WordPress admin panel, go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**. Select the ZIP file and click **Install Now**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Product configuration

For accurate LTL rates, configure each WooCommerce product with shipping dimensions:

- **Weight** -- Product weight in pounds
- **Dimensions** -- Length, width, height in inches
- **Freight class** -- NMFC freight class (use the ShipPeek custom field or a compatible plugin)
- **Packaging type** -- How the product is shipped (pallet, box, etc.)

## Shipping zones

The ShipPeek plugin works with WooCommerce shipping zones. Add ShipPeek as a shipping method in any zone where you want to display carrier rates at checkout.

## Troubleshooting

### No rates displayed at checkout

- Verify your API credentials are correct in the ShipPeek settings
- Check that the destination ZIP code is valid
- Ensure products in the cart have weight and dimensions configured
- Confirm your ShipPeek account has active carriers

### Rates are slow to load

The plugin queries multiple carriers in real-time. Consider using the `timeout` setting to limit how long to wait for slower carriers. A timeout of 10-15 seconds is recommended for checkout.

### Plugin version

The current plugin version is **v1.6.5**. Check for updates in your ShipPeek dashboard.
