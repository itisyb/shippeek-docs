ShipPeek connects to carriers via their native APIs. Each carrier has different capabilities for rating, booking, tracking, and document generation.

## Carrier capabilities

|---------|------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| AAA Cooper / MME | `aact` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| CCFS | `ccfs` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Dohrn Transfer | `dohr` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Dugan Truck Line | `dugn` | Yes | Yes | -- | Yes |
| Estes Express Lines | `exla` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| FedEx Freight | `fxfe` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Magnum LTL | `mgul` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Old Dominion (ODFL) | `odfl` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Rossi Transportation | `rosi` | Yes | Yes | -- | Yes |
| Saia LTL Freight | `saia` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Sutton Transport | `sutn` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| XPO Logistics | `xpol` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| UPS (Parcel) | `ups` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| FedEx (Parcel) | `fedex_parcel` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Filtering carriers in rate requests

Pass the `carriers` query parameter to limit which carriers return rates:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.shippeek.com/rates?carriers=exla,saia,odfl" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

Only the specified carriers are queried. Omit the parameter to get rates from all configured carriers.

## LTL carrier notes

### Facility type charges

Location-based accessorials (residential delivery, trade show, limited access, etc.) are automatically applied based on the `originType` and `destType` fields in your rate request. You do not need to list these in the `charges` array.

### Accessorials

LTL accessorials are passed in the `charges` array. See the [Accessorials reference](/reference/accessorials) for the full list.

<Warning>
  `arrival notice` and `arrival schedule` are mutually exclusive. Include one or the other, not both.
</Warning>

### Hazardous materials

If any item has `hazardous: true`, you must provide `emergencyName` and `emergencyPhone` in the booking request. Not all carriers support hazmat shipments -- unsupported carriers return an error status in the rate response.

## Parcel carrier notes

### UPS

- Supports `ups`, `upgf`, and `ups_parcel` as SCAC codes
- Ground, Express, and all standard UPS service levels are included
- Use carrier-specific packaging types (`UPS-letter`, `UPS-pak`, etc.) to get accurate packaging rates

### FedEx

- Supports `fedex_parcel` and `fxfe` (which handles both LTL and parcel)
- `indirect signature required` is only supported for residential destinations
- Use carrier-specific packaging types (`FedEx-envelope`, `FedEx-pak`, etc.) for FedEx packaging rates

## Adding carriers

Carrier availability is configured per account. Contact [yash@shippeek.com](mailto:yash@shippeek.com) to add or remove carriers from your account.
